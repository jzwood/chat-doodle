    NAME
    automata - a multiplayer game where cellular automata compete for supremacy.

    WIN CONDITION
    You win when your automata occupies at least 80% of the board.

    THE CATCH
    If any 2 different colored automata collide, every cell connected to the collection by association dies.

    DESCRIPTION
    The only way to interact with your automata is by defining Survival/Birth (S/B) conditions in the CLI.

    S - consists of a list of numbers, each of which represent how many living neighbors are necessary for a <span class="highlight">living</span> cell to <span class="highlight">survive</span>
    B - consists of a list of numbers, each of which represent how many living neighbors are necessary for a <span class="highlight">dead</span> cell to be <span class="highlight">born</span>

    USAGE
    $ /[0-9]*\/[0-9]*/

    EXAMPLES
    $ 0124/14
    $ /123
    $ 1356/

    FIG 1.

    0 | 1 | 0
    --+---+--
    0 | c | 1
    --+---+--
    0 | 0 | 1

    If we apply the S/B rule 134/25 to the cell depicted in FIG 1. we see that there are 3 living neighbors.

    we can deduce that if c is living (c=1) then it will survive b/c rule S includes 3.
    but if c is dead (c=0) then it will stay dead b/c rule B does not include 3.
